## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After some time away from pure JS/CSS/HTML, it was a great project to refresh some knowledge. Specifically:

- storing data in HTML data attributes
- working with JSON
- HTML structure
- making a bar chart in pure JS

### Useful resources

- [GitHub Gdsimoes](https://github.com/gdsimoes/expenses-chart-component/tree/main) - This helped me structure my JS functions. I did not follow this solution, but analyzing it at the beginning of the project helped me to get ideas what to be mindful of later.
- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com) - I used Chat GPT as my CSS mentor. It is a great resource to explain concepts quickly, clearly and with examples.
